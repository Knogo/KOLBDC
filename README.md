# KOLBDC
Dungeon Crawler - CST467 Web-based database applications
Contributors: Kenji and Levelle

Within the New Maven + Angular folder:
KOLBDC will be the maven project running spring and jdbc connectivity for a mySQL server for the backend.
dcapp will be the application, using angular for the frontend.
I've decided to leave the two parts seperate so that the components are still visible.

Preset using a mySQL database with the name KOLB, user and pass kolb (lowercase) within mySQL for the maven project.

Once the maven project is running - dcapp can be run using ng serve dcapp (or with -o option to run a browser instance immediately).

Attached is a small preview of the 'dungeon-crawler' portion in action.
